What is it?
===========

noice is a small curses-based file browser.
It was first developed to be used with a TV remote control for a media
center solution.


Getting started
===============

Get the latest version from the git-repository; build and install it.  Run
noice in a directory to display its content in the form of a list, where
each line is a file or directory.  The currently selected item will be
preceded with a " > " by default.

For more information refer to the manpage.


Building
========

To build noice you need a curses implementation available.  In most
cases you just do:

    make

It is known to work on OpenBSD, NetBSD, FreeBSD, DragonFly BSD, Linux, OSX,
IRIX 6.5, Haiku and Solaris 9.  Some notes for building on certain systems
follow.

 * IRIX 6.5:
   Tested with gcc from http://freeware.sgi.com/.

    make CC="gcc" LDLIBS="-lgen -lcurses"

 * Haiku:

    make LDLIBS="-lncurses"

 * Solaris 9:
   Tested with gcc from http://www.opencsw.org/.

    export PATH=/usr/ccs/bin:/opt/csw/bin:$PATH
    make CC="gcc"
